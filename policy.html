              EEA Residents: Pursuant to EEA Data Protection Law, we process this personal information to satisfy our legitimate interests as described above.
              </p>
              <h4>INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTY SOURCES</h4>
              <p>From time to time, we may obtain information about you from third party sources as required or permitted by applicable law, such as public databases, credit bureaus, ID verification partners, resellers and channel partners, joint marketing partners, and social media platforms.</p>
              <h4>COLLECTION & USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY</h4>
              <p>We receive and store certain types of information automatically, such as whenever you interact with the Sites or use the Services. This information does not necessarily reveal your identity directly but may include information about the specific device you are using, such as the hardware model, device ID, operating system version, web-browser software (such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer) and your Internet Protocol (IP) address/MAC address/device identifier. For example, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including how you came to and used the Services; your IP address; device type and unique device identification numbers, device event information (such as crashes, system activity and hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL), broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) and other technical data collected through cookies, pixel tags and other similar technologies that uniquely identify your browser. We may also collect information about how your device has interacted with our website, including pages accessed and links clicked. We may use identifiers to recognise you when you arrive at the Site via an external link, such as a link appearing on a third party site.</p>
              <h4>HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h4>
              <p>We share personal data with:
                Any person that works for us or for one of our group companies;
                Any entity that forms part of Firstprofit, including where relevant the Firstprofit operating entity in the country or region in which you live;
                Financial and other institutions we partner with to provide our products and services; Companies and organisations that provide services to us, including in relation to technical infrastructure, marketing and analytics, and web and app development;
                companies and organisations that assist us with identity verification, background screening, due diligence and processing or otherwise fulfilling transactions that you have requested;
                Our professional advisers, consultants and other similar services. We will otherwise treat your personal data as private and confidential and will not share it with other parties except where you have given permission;
                Where we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with any law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our customers or others;
                Where we may transfer rights and obligations pursuant to our agreement with you.</p>
                <h4>HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
                <p>We understand how important your privacy is, which is why Firstprofit maintains (and requires its service providers to maintain) appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of the personal information you entrust to us.<br>
                  We may store and process all or part of your personal and transactional information, where our facilities or our service providers are located. We protect your personal information by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.
                  For example, we use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorise access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. Full credit card data is securely transferred and hosted off-site by a payment vendor in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). This information is not accessible to Firstprofit or firstprofit staff.<br>
                  However, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorised acquisition, or alteration of your data will not occur. Please recognise that you play a vital role in protecting your own personal information. When registering with our Services, it is important to choose a password of sufficient length and complexity, to not reveal this password to any third-parties, and to immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorised access to or use of your account.<br>
                  Furthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of information you transmit to us or receive from us by Internet or wireless connection, including email, phone, or SMS, since we have no way of protecting that information once it leaves and until it reaches us. If you have reason to believe that your data is no longer secure, please contact us via support.
                  </p>
                  <h4>HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CHANGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
                  <p>You are entitled to review, correct, or amend your personal information, or to delete that information where it is inaccurate. You may do this at any time by contacting support.
                    If you close your Firstprofit Account, we will mark your account in our database as "Closed," but will keep your account information in our database for a period of time described above. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if you close your account, your personal information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <h4>RIGHTS IN RELATION TO THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
                    <p><b>Rights of access, correction and deletion</b>
                      You have a right of access to the personal information that we hold about you under European data protection legislation, and to some related information. You can also require any inaccurate personal information to be corrected or deleted.
                      </p>
                      <h4>RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
                      <p>We store your personal information securely throughout the life of your Firstprofit Account. We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations or to resolve disputes. While retention requirements vary by jurisdiction, information about our typical retention periods for different aspects of your personal information are described below.<br>
                        Contact Information such as your name, email address and telephone number for marketing purposes is retained on an ongoing basis until you un-subscribe. Thereafter we will add your details to our suppression list indefinitely.<br>
                        Content that you post on our website such as support desk comments, photographs, videos, blog posts, and other content may be kept indefinitely after you close your account for audit and crime prevention purposes.
                        Recording of our telephone calls with you may be kept for a period of up to six years.<br>
                        Information collected via technical means such as cookies, webpage counters and other analytics tools is kept for a period of up to one year from expiry of the cookie.</p>
                        <h4>CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
                        <p>We do not knowingly request to collect personal information from any person under the age of 18. If a user submitting personal information is suspected of being younger than 18 years of age, Firstprofit will require the user to close his or her account and will not allow the user to continue transacting digital currencies using Firstprofit. We will also take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Please notify us if you know of any individuals under the age of 18 using our Services so we can take action to prevent access to our Services.
                        </p>
                        <h4>GLOBAL COMPANY</h4>
                        <p>The personal data we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside, and the laws of those countries may differ from the laws applicable in your own country. For example, data collected in the European Economic Area (EEA) may be transferred to, stored and processed at a destination(s) outside of the EEA. Any processing of such data will be undertaken by our staff, or the staff of our third-party service providers, whose roles will include verifying your identity, processing payment details, and providing customer support.</p>
                        <p><strong>By accepting this Privacy Policy, and then submitting your personal data, you agree to the transfer, storing or processing of it outside of your jurisdiction.</strong></p>
